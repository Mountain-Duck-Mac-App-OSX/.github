## 📊 Overview  

Mountain Duck is a powerful tool that allows users to mount remote servers and cloud storage as local drives, giving direct Finder access to files stored in the cloud or on remote infrastructure. Instead of switching between multiple apps or interfaces, Mountain Duck presents all external locations in a unified way, making remote data feel as accessible as local folders. This design significantly improves workflow efficiency for anyone working with distributed storage environments.  

The app supports a wide range of protocols and cloud platforms, including FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, Amazon S3, Google Cloud, Backblaze B2, Microsoft Azure, OpenStack Swift, and many more. Once mounted, users can browse, rename, open, and move files directly through their file manager. All operations behave naturally, allowing seamless interaction with remote assets without requiring background syncing or additional copying.  

A key focus of Mountain Duck is data security. The application integrates advanced encryption features, ensuring that sensitive information, credentials, and stored content remain protected during transfer and storage. Its smart caching system enhances performance, making remote access faster and more stable. Whether you handle large file collections, collaborate with distributed teams, or manage cloud environments, the app provides reliable and consistent access to your data.  

With minimal system overhead and strong stability, Mountain Duck is suited for a wide variety of use cases—from creative professionals working with media files, to administrators managing server directories, to individuals who want a more integrated approach to cloud storage. Its intuitive interface and robust compatibility transform remote storage into a natural extension of your device, offering a unified and efficient working environment.
